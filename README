With the way I have the webMVC currently, you will have to build your own yard work, and your own location. In the fully shipped app/website a third party maps api would be 
integrated. You would still be able to make any work you want done possible to your yard. Before logging in you will see the home logo, about, and contact tabs. When you log in
you will have full access to the site, this is the best thing I have ever built and now I look forward to the future of my software journey.
